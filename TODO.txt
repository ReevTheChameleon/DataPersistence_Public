TODO List:
Note: This project uses UsefulScripts package v1.8.0
Things that can be improved:
1) Learn how to quit WebGL properly, because Application.Quit() seems to hang. Alternatives can be to call JavaScript to reload the page
or make specific code for WebGL. Learning how usual WebGL or web games quit can also be beneficial.
2) Combine sprites of "How to Play" section into sprite sheet. I have tried SpriteAtlas before, but Unity packs them into sheets with
large unused space whatever the settings, or multiple small sheets which defeat the purpose.
Because each sprite has power of 2 dimension, it shouldn't be this hard. Will study how to quickly do this ourselves or write code to automate
the process.
3) I have found out later that Rigidbody2D is not really the way to go for brick breaking game, and other people suggest using custom code
to have full control of how the ball should react when collision occurs (In fact this also seems to be the case for ANY 2D games?).
4) I should study how usual Unity's .gitignore is set up, because using default settings from GitHub Desktop includes .meta, .vsconfig, WebGL Build
files outside Assets folder, ProjectSettings, etc., many of which I think is unnecessary (OK .meta may be necessary if working with other people?)
